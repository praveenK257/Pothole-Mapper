# Pothole-Mapper
A webpage where pothole data will get updated from Thingspeak cloud. We can use any microcontroller like Arduino or NodeMCU and configure it to send data to the ThingSpeak cloud. Then it will be dispayed here.

1) OpenLayers map API has been used to create map.
2) jQuery has been used to read JSON data from the ThingSpeak channel.
3) JavaScript code does the plotting in the map.
